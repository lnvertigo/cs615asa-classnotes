# **2 | The Job of a System Admin**
> Ultimately not well defined.

## **VALID EXAMPLES**
> - "order to chaos"
> 	- eg cable organization
> - The **designs of various systems** and > requirements for them
> 	- cooling
> 	- network security and segregated > zones
> 	- connection shit with up to 50 > different adaptors and cables
> 	- wifi network administration > (security too)
> 	- coding/programming
> 	- cmd work
> - building, supporting, maintaining every > aspect of a network
> 	- network equipment handling
> 	- web server handling
> - DIY guy
> 	- woodworking/metalworking
> 	- electrician work
> 		- diesel generator and backup > power
> - problem solver

## **DEFINITION**?
> - no precise JOB DESCRIPTION (look at the > list above)
> - no precise JOB NAME either
> 	- IT support
> 	- operator
> 	- network admin
> 	- sys programmer (???)
> 	- sys manager
> 	- sys engie
> 	- *site reliability engie*
> - often learned while on the job
> - "makes things run"
> - work behind the scenes

## **God bless the dictionary**
> **system admin (n)**  
> one who, as a primary job function, manages computer and network systems on behalf of another, such as an employer or client

> ***Sysadmins solve people's problems by computering harder.***

# **3 | Core Principles and Rules**
## **Intro**
	adding scalability and security into a system after implementation is IMPOSSIBLE
## **Scalability**
	horse metaphor, haha
 if the wagon's too big for a single horse, some options:
>> scale VERTICALLY
>	- get a bigger horse
>	- "throw money at issue"
>> scale HORIZONTALLY
>	- get more horses
>	- add complexity (load balancer)
>> scale DOWN
>	- use a dog instead
>	- adapt to changing loads that affect ***COSTS***

## **Security**
common misconceptions:

	- security is inversely related to usability
	- security must be an enabling factor, present from the very beginning of the design process

## **Simplicity**
	complicated vs. complex
>> **complex**  
>	may be well-organized and have a clear, logical structure yet require subtle or intricate connections or components
>
>> **complicated**  
>	irregular, unpredictable, or difficult to follow
> 
>> **KISS**  
>	words to live by
>
>> **UNIX philosophy**  
> build smaller tools to use as blocks to create into bigger complex systems (akin to LEGO)

## **Sysadmin's Favorite Laws**
### Occam's Razor
>> **FOR A GIVEN PROBLEM, THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION IS USUALLY THE CORRECT ONE.** 
>
> a method to solve complex and complicated problems

### 2nd Law of Thermodynamics
>> **THE ENTROPY OF AN ENCLOSED SYSTEM GROWS WITH TIME.**
>
> The more shit you have, the more chaos and shit you'll need to deal with.

### Hanlon's Razor
>> **YOU SHOULD NEVER ATTRIBUTE TO MALICE THAT WHICH IS ADEQUATELY EXPLAINED BY STUPIDITY.**
>
> aka if people are being dumbasses, they're not doing it on purpose

easy to jump to conclusions and assume a bad actor changed fucked up everything, but it's probably just a user doing it on accident

### Pareto's Principle (80/20)
>> **IN MOST CASES 80% OF CONSEQUENCES DERIVE FROM 20% OF THE CAUSES.**
>
> 20% of the main program/task is the source of 80% of shit

### Sturgeon's Law
>> **90% OF EVERYTHING IS CRAP.**
>
> Most of everything is "not outstanding". Includes tools.

### Murphy's Law
>> **ANYTHING THAT CAN GO WRONG, WILL GO WRONG.**
>
> Get ready for anything that can happen.

### Causality
>> **FOR EVERY EFFECT, THERE MUST BE A CAUSE.**

# **4 | UNIX History**
## **Intro**
| Year | What | Location | People |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1969 | UNIX (assembly) | AT&T Bell Labs NJ | Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie 
| 1973 | UNIX rewritten in C | - | - 
| 1975 | Berkeley Software Dist (BSD) of UNIX | Berkeley |  Thompson, Joy, Haley, Berkeley students
| 1982 | Sun Microsystems founded/UNIX split into BSD and "System V" | - | Chuck Haley and Bill Joy

## **Notable Dates**
| Year | What |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1984 | 4.2BSD released (TCP/IP)
| 1986 | 4.3BSD (NFS)
| 1991 | Linus Torvald starts working on Linux kernel
| 1993 | Settlement of USL vs. BSDi; NetBSD and FreeBSD created
| 1994 | Single UNIX spec introduced
| 1995 | 4.4BSD-Lite Release 2 (last CSRG release)/OpenBSD forked off NetBSD
| 2000 | Darwin created (deriv from NeXT, FreeBSD, NetBSD)
| 2003 | Xen/SELinux
| 2005 | Hadoop/DTrace/ZFS/Solaris containers
| 2006 | AWS ("cloud computing")
| 2007 | iOS/KVM appears in Linux
| 2008 | Android/Solaris open sourced as OpenSolaris

## **Different UNIX Versions**
|type|explanation|
|---|---|
| all caps UNIX systems | derive directly from AT&T code
| trademark UNIX versions | (expensive) UNIX specification certification acquired
| UNIX-like | OSes with no lineage or code, but behave just like a UNIX system

>Linux distributions can be picked apart and shoved together into their own "distributions" for each company.

>BSD and other OSes can only be used in their entirety.

### **NetBSD**
>Class will focus on using NetBSD.  

	NetBSD is a direct true genetic UNIX without the UNIX trademark.

> NetBSD provides a coherent OS image with:
> 	- a kernel
> 	- system libraries
> 	- various utilities

## **BSD History**
NetBSD has the history of UNIX in:
```bsh
/usr/share/misc/bsd-family-tree
```

## **UNIX History Timeline**
Giant horizontal timeline.

## **Linux Genealogy Timeline**
Giant vertical timeline with god knows how many Linux distributions.

## **UNIX Everywhere**
- UNIX is used in pretty much everything, including IoT devices.
- This also means that there is substantial risk.

# **5 | Just enough git (but w/o GitHub)**
## **Intro**
> Git is a distributed version control service.
## **SSH Configuration**
```
ssh linux-lab.cs.stevens-tech.edu
```
> host fingerprints for ssh-ing into linux-lab 
```
curl https://stevens.netmeister.org/known_hosts
```
> append the host fingerprints into the known_hosts file
```
curl -s https://stevens.netmeister.org/known_hosts | tail -f >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

> create an alias for linux-lab.cs... to just stevens
``` bsh
cat >> ~/.ssh/config <<EOF
Host stevens
	HostName linux-lab.cs.stevens-tech.edu
	StrictHostKeyChecking yes (known_hosts has the fingerprints)
	User __stevens_username__ (ajin1 for me)
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/stevens
	IdentitiesOnly yes (forward only correct identities)
	LogLevel QUIET
EOF
```

## **Git Repo Init and Use**
> set email and default push model
```
git config --global --edit
	name = Aaron Jin
	email = ajin1@stevens.edu
git config --global push.default simple
```
> make raw git repo
```
mkdir .cs615.git
cd .cs615.git/
git init --bare
cd ..
git clone /home/ajin1/.cs615.git/cs615
cd cs615
cat >README <<EOF
	This repo will contain all coursework for cs615 sysadmin
	EOF
git add README
git commit -m 'init cs615 repo'
git push
```
> clone the local git repo on linux-lab to main computer
```
git clone stevens:.cs615.git cs615
cd cs615
--- add shit and push as usual ---
```
