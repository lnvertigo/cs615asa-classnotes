# **2 | The Job of a System Admin**
> Ultimately not well defined.

## **VALID EXAMPLES**
> - "order to chaos"
> 	- eg cable organization
> - The **designs of various systems** and > requirements for them
> 	- cooling
> 	- network security and segregated > zones
> 	- connection shit with up to 50 > different adaptors and cables
> 	- wifi network administration > (security too)
> 	- coding/programming
> 	- cmd work
> - building, supporting, maintaining every > aspect of a network
> 	- network equipment handling
> 	- web server handling
> - DIY guy
> 	- woodworking/metalworking
> 	- electrician work
> 		- diesel generator and backup > power
> - problem solver

## **DEFINITION**?
> - no precise JOB DESCRIPTION (look at the > list above)
> - no precise JOB NAME either
> 	- IT support
> 	- operator
> 	- network admin
> 	- sys programmer (???)
> 	- sys manager
> 	- sys engie
> 	- *site reliability engie*
> - often learned while on the job
> - "makes things run"
> - work behind the scenes

## **God bless the dictionary**
> **system admin (n)**  
> one who, as a primary job function, manages computer and network systems on behalf of another, such as an employer or client

> ***Sysadmins solve people's problems by computering harder.***

# **3 | Core Principles and Rules**
## **Intro**
	adding scalability and security into a system after implementation is IMPOSSIBLE
## **Scalability**
	horse metaphor, haha
 if the wagon's too big for a single horse, some options:
 - scale VERTICALLY
 	- get a bigger horse
 	- "throw money at issue"
 - scale HORIZONTALLY
 	- get more horses
 	- add complexity (load balancer)
 - scale DOWN
 	- use a dog instead
 	- adapt to changing loads that affect ***COSTS***

## **Security**
common misconceptions:

	- security is inversely related to usability
	- security must be an enabling factor, present from the very beginning of the design process

## **Simplicity**
	complicated vs. complex
>**complex**  
> >	may be well-organized and have a clear, logical structure yet require subtle or intricate connections or components
>
>**complicated**  
> >	irregular, unpredictable, or difficult to follow
> 
>**KISS**  
> >	words to live by
>
>**UNIX philosophy**  
> > build smaller tools to use as blocks to create into bigger complex systems (akin to LEGO)

## **Sysadmin's Favorite Laws**
### Occam's Razor
> **FOR A GIVEN PROBLEM, THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION IS USUALLY THE CORRECT ONE.**
> > a method to solve complex and complicated problems

### 2nd Law of Thermodynamics
> **THE ENTROPY OF AN ENCLOSED SYSTEM GROWS WITH TIME.**
> > The more shit you have, the more chaos and shit you'll need to deal with.

### Hanlon's Razor
> **YOU SHOULD NEVER ATTRIBUTE TO MALICE THAT WHICH IS ADEQUATELY EXPLAINED BY STUPIDITY.**
> > aka if people are being dumbasses, they're not doing it on purpose

easy to jump to conclusions and assume a bad actor changed fucked up everything, but it's probably just a user doing it on accident

### Pareto's Principle (80/20)
> **IN MOST CASES 80% OF CONSEQUENCES DERIVE FROM 20% OF THE CAUSES.**
> > 20% of the main program/task is the source of 80% of shit

### Sturgeon's Law
> **90% OF EVERYTHING IS CRAP.**
> > Most of everything is "not outstanding". Includes tools.

### Murphy's Law
> **ANYTHING THAT CAN GO WRONG, WILL GO WRONG.**
> > Get ready for anything that can happen.

### Causality
> **FOR EVERY EFFECT, THERE MUST BE A CAUSE.**
