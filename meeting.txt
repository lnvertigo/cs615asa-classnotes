Keynote: Baking Cysec into Enterprise IT

	- C19 caused reshuffling of structures for all orgs.
		- remote became viable
	- C19 created new targets
		- change in volumn and types
		- orgs are shifting to cloud and needing to secure it
	- C19 showed the lowest probs of risk of large scale disaster can still happen

	- private sector
		- more orgs differenciate on trust
			- includes sharing info
				- what trust is based on
				- how trust is role in innovation
				- how trust allows collab

	- our prio to find balance betw security, privacy, growth

	- set responsible policies and frameworks and processes
		- shapes security for all

	- last year: how can we provide more of that info on self-service basis?
		- got more popular

	2: guiding principles
	- industry collab/progress didn't stop

		- 1: to enable better comms, need to provide clarity on laws procedures or actions
			- make sure incentives are there
			- to engage in info sharing events/activities

		- 2: provide access to trusted and valued indicators
			- what's valuable, trusted, actual

		- 3: provide opportunities to codesign solutions with stakeholders on actions they shoudl take, how to distinguish geniune reports, how to report events

	back to trust
		- what is trust
			- value of doign business
			- confidence that __ would be held

		1: establish governence/policy frameworks, checking resilience, and they're being followed

		culture of security and collab

		2: reflect on how attacks change as time passes
			shared responsbiliity
			+ risk, + opportunity to secure apps, envs, and collab methods

		incident count +
		ransomeware +
		top 5 targets were changed
			retail
			hospitality/healthcare
		remote acces ssystems = attack vectors
		healthcare +45% increase

		cloud adoption surpassed prediction by nearly 5 years

		cysec growth, hiring ppl with degrees, more women

	collab increased betw providers AND *customers*

	mobile devices for work
		- became another attack vector
		- another collab opportunity

	customer expectations grew too

	globally aligned architecture

	slide 2 - resilience guiding principles
		- people are most valuable asset
		- transparency critical
		- use risk-based approach
		- security is crit business req
		- automating security

panel - Network Security for 2021 and Beyond
	1: key challenges during covid
		MEG DIAZ:
			- cisco
			- how threats changed
			- few trends
				- attackers took adv in pandemic and phished (40% increase)
				- trojans and droppers getting "2nd life" as delivery
		JOHN:
			- took adv of __??__
			- locked things down, expansive vpn
			- didn't expand control at the same time, caused issues
			- surface area of atk
			- risk management measures vs business measures
				- do whatever has to be done to get basic things to work
		TIM:
			- southeast - had everything set for remote bc of hurricanes
				- still had a massive rush
				- last min vpns with full stack access and untrusted devices
			- RND budget increase proposal = unmanaged device count
				- untunneled vpn
				- unpatched boxes
			- influx of lame malware attacks
				- works because of unmanaged unpatched devices
			- proves need to have a plan
			- zero/verified trust
		JEFF:
			- bank: 50k concurrent users
			- are firewalls good enough for this issue?
	2: accel of SASE - secure access service edge
		MEG:
			- SASE got a kickstart since 2019
		TIM:
			- proper SASE = 
				- question becomes: how to spin up VPN -> why spin up VPN?
					- bc it was easy? bc everyone's familiar with it?
			- rethink who gets fullstack access and why people get the rights they do
		JOHN:
			- data focused approach > tech focused approach
			- big part of world still runs on legacy tech
				- to what degree can we acommadite
			- securty supports availability
				- relax contrl for availability
			- risk/tech based approach
				- not as successful as legacy stuff
			- are we solving problems? or are we creating new ones?
			- once an endpoint had access to pt 80 and 443, sase didn't matter at all
				- printers, phones, personal devices can't run new tech like crowdstrike
		JEFF:
			- hybrid
				- legacy/secure access
				- cloud/sase architecture
				+ on-prem/private cloud/public cloud
			- (2005) knack
				- companies still don't know what's connected to their systemse
				- get accurate inventory of legacy systems and find out how to brings those up to speed
				- these gaps are the vulnerabilities that are hit the most
		MEG: "how to bring old tech along as we converge to sase"
			- sase is not 1 size fits all
				- some locations might still need on prem
				- some might need cloud
			- sase still needs on prem a path to the cloud
		JEFF:
			- is there less traffic
			- is there fewer attacks
			- 2020 was very successul for firewall market
			
	3: reccomendations about netowrk security and how to approach/prioritize some of the threats (supply chain atks)
		TIM: how you're prioing
			- approach IDing the assets
			- significant onprem harrdware
			- treat that as diff problem to access problem
			- divide them up as policy perspec in how assets are managed
				- take local admin rights from endpoints
				- leverage some cloud solutions to help deploy with patches, move pshl scripts to sujpport remote policies, take advntge of tools to secure prooperly
			- need a way to insure a way to allow users to dl what they want and go to what site they want
		JOHN:
			- dist vs centralized computing
			- netowrk always been core of convo
			- what problem are they trying to solve?
			- what do i care about and why?
			- what are the high probability things, and what would it impact?
			- pay attneiton to what hurts
			- get the hygiene done b4 worrying about stuff like sase
			- balance betw what works and what doesn't
		JEFF:
			- security vendors are a partner
			- how do they cover legacy/modern systems/cloud/cloud delivery?
				- what tools are being offered?
		MEG:
			- SASE could be so broad it'd be overwhelming
			- go back for bases
			- what are major use cases
ending
	JEFF:
		- trust but verify
