BEFORE
===================
I took Intro to Cybersecurity with Professor Amoroso, and this topic is particularly interesting to me as I like valuing concepts like risk or understandability, which is a key part of risk assessment and management.

- How much of the system's security does a system admin have to manage?
- Is there a limit to how much security is mandatory for policy's sake?
- Is there a set limit of security before users get aggravated that people have found out through experience?

Watched some of the videos from the website:

- Political intentions are just as integral to security policy as the policy themselves.
- Assets can be abstract, like access or reputation, not just physical.

Key takeaways:
- Never waste resources on unspecified vague risks or FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt).
- Always remember that risks are scoped and specific.
- Minimize risk by closing options (close atk vector/vulns), reducing the size of options (attack surface), and making it costly for attackers (eco of adversary).

AFTER
===================
- Securing anything at a scale like that of a government entity is a LOT of politicking.
