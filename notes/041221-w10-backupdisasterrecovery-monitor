BEFORE
===================
- regular backups are important, but could backups be a liability in themselves?
- how important are offsite backups? could backups that are disconnected from the main site suffice?

AFTER
===================
- logs of events (metrics) are key for identifying attacks as they occur or already occurred
	- exec time, data src/dest, and hardware usage/uptime
- context is KEY
	- a spike in disk I/O during downtime would be different from a spike that occurs in a regular time period
