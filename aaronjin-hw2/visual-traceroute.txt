Throughout several of these traceroutes, all of them have a few common hosts that they go through before arriving to the destination.
	Using traceroute through the AWS shells required more hops than the visual tools, likely due to the nature of calling through a machine that lives on AWS servers and has to go through the AWS infrastructure before it can search for the route in earnest. It takes about 20 hops for OmniOS to reach a common host with the visual tracker's 8 hops. For example:
		When reaching 206.195.187.229:
			my machine: 	9	bu-ether11.asbnva1611w-bcr00.tbone.rr.com	66.109.6.30	133.716ms
			OmniOS	:		21  bu-ether12.tustca4200w-bcr00.tbone.rr.com (66.109.6.0)  72.236 ms 
								\	100.91.143.63 (100.91.143.63)  33.303 ms 100.91.143.179 (100.91.143.179)  33.599 ms

	In many of the traceroutes, a lot of packets for the visual tracker started in or near London, UK and often visited locations found in the middle of the US if the destinations were on the opposite continent, such as Hawaii or Uruguay.

	Depending on how big the AS networks are, some traces go through 7 ASes, others need about half of the number of hops in ASes.

	An interesting connection is the connection for the last IP, 211.233.84.186, which connected from the UK, to midwest US, then all the way to South Korea, which I thought would be a connection through European countries instead, but that wasn't the case at all.
